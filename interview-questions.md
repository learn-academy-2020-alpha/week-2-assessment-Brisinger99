## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React lifecycle methods
    Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process
- API
    a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.
- event.preventDefault()
    The Event interface's preventDefault() method tells the user agent that if the event does not get explicitly handled, its default action should not be taken as it normally would be.
- DOM events
    HTML DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document.
